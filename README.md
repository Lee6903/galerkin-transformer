# Requirements
To install requirements:

```setup
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Data
The data is courtesy of [Mr. Zongyi Li (Caltech)](https://github.com/zongyi-li): https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator under the MIT license.

# Examples
All examples are learning PDE-related operators. The setting can be found in [`config.yml`](./config.yml). By default the evaluation is performed on the last 100 samples in the test dataset. All trainers are using the `1cycle` scheduler for 100 epochs.

## Example 1: Burgers equation
The baseline benchmark [`ex1_burgers.py`](./ex1_burgers.py): evaluation relative error is about `1e-3` with a simple pointwise forward expansion feature extractor. The input is the initial condition of a viscous Burgers' equation on a discrete grid, the output is an approximation to the solution marched to time $1$. The initial data are generating using a GRF and the data in the validation set are not in the train set.

Default benchmark on a 2048 grid using a Fourier Transformer, with 4 Fourier-type attention layers as the encoder and 2 spectral convolution layers from [Li et al 2020](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator) as the decoder:
```bash
python ex1_burgers.py --seed 1127802
```
No subsampling (8192 grid), Galerkin-type attention, adding a diagonal matrix to the Xavier initializations of the `W^Q, W^K, W^V` matrices (about 30% better than those without).
```bash
python ex1_burgers.py --subsample 1\
                      --attn-type 'galerkin'\
                      --xavier-init 0.01 --diag-weight 0.01
```
Using standard softmax normalization `Softmax(QK^T/sqrt{d})V`, conventional layer normalization application scheme in attention layers
```bash
python ex1_burgers.py --attn-type 'softmax'\
                      --reg-layernorm\
                      --xavier-init 1.0 --diag-weight 0.0
```

## Example 2: Interface Darcy flow
The baseline benchmark [`ex2_darcy.py`](./ex2_darcy.py): evaluation relative error is about `1e-2` with an interpolation-based CNN (CiNN) feature extractor. The coarse grid latent representation is sent to attention layers The operator input is discontinuous coefficient with a random interface sampled at a discrete grid, the output is a finite difference approximation to the solution restricted to the sampled grid from a `421x421` grid. The coefficient in the validation set are not in the train set.

Default benchmark on a 141x141 grid using the Galerkin Transformer, 10 Galerkin-type attention layers as the encoder and 2 spectral conv layers from [Li et al 2020](https://github.com/zongyi-li/fourier_neural_operator) as the decoder. There is a small dropout `5e-2` in the attention layer as well as in the feature extraction layer:
```bash
python ex2_darcy.py
```
For a smaller memory GPU or CPU, please use the 85x85 grid fine, 29x29 coarse grid example:
```bash
python ex2_darcy.py --subsample-attn 15\
                    --subsample-nodes 5\
                    --attn-type 'galerkin'\
                    --xavier-init 0.01 --diag-weight 0.01
```
## Example 3: Inverse interface coefficient identification for Darcy flow
The baseline benchmark [`ex3_darcy_inv.py`](./ex3_darcy_inv.py): an inverse coefficient identification problem based on the same dataset used in Example 2. However, in this example, the input and the target are reversed, i.e., the target is the interface coefficient with a random geometry, and the input is the finite difference approximation to the PDE problem, together with an optional noise added to the input to simulate measurement errors. As a limit of the attention operator, the coefficient cannot be resolved at the resolution, the target is sampled at a lower resolution than the input.

Default benchmark is on a 211x211 fine grid input and a 71x71 coarse grid coefficient output. The model is the Galerkin Transformer with 6 Galerkin-type attention layers (`dmodel=192`, `nhead=4`) stacked with a simple pointwise feed-forward neural network to map the attention output back the desired dimension. There is a small dropout in every key components of the network (`5e-2`). The noise is added to the normalized input, so 0.01 noise means 1%, and 0.1 means 10%.
```bash
python ex3_darcy_inv.py --noise 0.01
```
For a smaller memory GPU, please use the 141x141 grid fine, 36x36 coarse grid, and avoid using the local attention `fourier` or `softmax` in the `--attn-type` switch:
```bash
python ex3_darcy_inv.py --subsample-attn 12\
                        --subsample-nodes 3\
                        --attn-type 'galerkin'\
                        --xavier-init 0.01 --diag-weight 0.01
```

# Memory and speed profiling using `autograd.profiler`
Using CUDA, Fourier Transformer features an over 40% reduction in `self_cuda_memory_usage` versus the standard softmax normalized transformers, and Galerkin Transformer's the backpropagation speed has a 20% to 100% increase over the standard linearized transformers. If no GPU is available please enable the `--no-cuda` switch.

Example 1 memory profile of a model with 96 hidden dimension with an input sequence length 8192. Compare the memory usage of the Fourier transformer with the one with softmax
```bash
python ex1_memory_profile.py --batch-size 2 --seq-len 8192 --dmodel 96 --attn-type 'softmax' 'fourier'
```
Compare the backpropagation time usage of the Galerkin transformer versus the same net, but with Galerkin-type simple attention replaced by the standard linearized attention. 
```bash
python ex1_memory_profile.py --batch-size 2 --seq-len 8192 --dmodel 96 --num-iter 100 --attn-type 'linear' 'galerkin'
```

Example 2 memory profile of a 2D model with 64 hidden dimension, using the default `141x141` fine grid, `43x43` coarse grid set up.
```bash
python ex2_memory_profile.py --batch-size 2 --dmodel 64 --attn-type 'softmax' 'fourier' 'linear' 'galerkin'
```

Encoder layer wrapper profiling: profile a wrapper with 10 layers of encoder in a model for operators defined for functions whose domain is isomorphic to a 2D Euclidean space.
```bash
python encoder_memory_profile.py --batch-size 4 --dmodel 96 --num-layers 10 -ndim 2
```
